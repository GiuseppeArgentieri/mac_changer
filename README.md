# MAC Address Changer

## I have created this program that allows you to change the MAC address of a network interface. It works on Linux-based operating systems and can be executed using a command similar to the following:

```console
python3 main.py --interface eth0 --mac 00:11:22:33:44:55
```
or
```console
python3 main.py -i eth0 -m 00:11:22:33:44:55
```
Where:
--interface specifies the network interface you want to change. In the example above, eth0 is used as an example interface.
--mac sets the new MAC address you want to assign to the interface. In the example above, 00:11:22:33:44:55 is used as an example MAC address that you want to assign to the interface.
